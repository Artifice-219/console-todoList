# Task CLI Application

This is a basic command-line interface (CLI) application. I'm building this primarily to familiarize myself with the C# language and its core functionalities. It currently allows you to add, view, edit, and mark tasks as done using lists.

## Features

* **Add New Tasks:** Create and add new tasks to your to-do list.
* **View Tasks:** Display all the tasks currently in your list.
* **Edit Tasks:** Modify the content of existing tasks.
* **Mark as Done:** Remove tasks from the list, simulating completion.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the project files (likely where the `.csproj` file is located).
3.  Run the application using the command: `dotnet run`

## Usage

Once the application starts, you'll be presented with a menu of options. Follow the prompts to interact with your task list.

## Disclaimer

This is a learning project and may not have extensive error handling or advanced features. The primary goal is to practice and understand C# concepts.
